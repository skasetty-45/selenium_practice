Window Handle Mechanism

* Opening Another Tab is same as window as it is new one from current page
* Scope of a run is always in the first URL opened
* Us Switch Command to switch to Another window or Tab ( which is called Child window)
* After closing the child or new tab, We have to switch to the main window via command.
* driver.windowhandles() will get the name of all the windows in a List and return it


# Iframes
1. Dev can inform that the element is in Iframe
2. Inspect the HTML element and then check if it is iframe
3. To switch to these frames we need to use switch commands

# Events need Javascript to load and we need the same to automate them

* using Javascript we can do the same like manipulate
* For this we need to execute the Javascript on Browser data
* To check Goto Dev>Console > window. then you can see all the applicable methods to Actions
Ex: window.scrollBy(0,document.body.scrollHeight) -- > moves the webpage to the bottom of the page
command : driver.execute_script("window.scrollBy(0,document.body.scrollHeight);")

# Head less Mode - The broswer will run in backend without any UI on the screen

---- Options ----------
Headless is one of the example for this.
1. For this we need to create options before invoking a browser by creating an object for browser options
2. For that After browser options are created that need to be passed on as argument ot the service object
3. If we are testing any internal website we can use , Ignore certificate errors as an argument while invoking the browser
ex: --ignore-certificate-error
4. We can invoke particular user with browser command in options
